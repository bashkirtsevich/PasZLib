<h1>DelphiZlib 0.2.99</h1>

Yes, this is version 0.2.99. It doesn't mean this component is not
usable, it means that I'm not sure if I like it the way it works now.
Until I release version 1.0.0 some property's could change (Of course I
will keep the newer versions backwards compatible for a while.)

<p>
Please read the legal notes at the end of this file.

<p>
DelphiZlib is based on the zlib 1.1.2 general purpose data compression
library. The <b>original Zlib library</b> can be found on <a
href="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/">
http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/</a> The Pascal implementation
I used is by <b>Jacques Nomssi Nzali</b>.  Because he did such a great
job, writing this component was easy. I changed only a few bytes in the
original code in order to avoid some compilation-warnings.  <p>I did
only include the files I needed for this component. Some of them I
changed a bit. For the complete and original PASZLIB-code I refer to: <a
href="http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~nomssi/paszlib.html">
http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~nomssi/paszlib.html</a> Read also <a
href="paszlib.txt">paszlib.txt</a>, which is in fact the original
readme.txt by Jacques Nomssi Nzali and contains more information. [And
yes, I copied some lines from this file]

<p>
The untar-code is based on <b>extar 1.0</b> made by <b>TapirSoft Gisbert
W.Selke</b> (feb 1990). The untar code is a quick implementation that might
not work correctly will all tar-files.

<h2><a NAME="components"></a>The components</h2>
The components can be used after installing it the normal way in Delphi
4. Someone told me it also works for Delphi 5 and I guess it will also
work for Delphi 3 and would appreciate when somebody can mail me if it
indeed works. Please ignore the compiler hints. I did not yet clean up
or optimize the code.

<p>
To install (Delphi 4):<br>
Just unpack the zip-file into a directory where you want to keep your
components. Then choose <b>[File]</b>,<b>[Open]</b> and select the file
'<b>DelphiZlib.dpk</b>'. In the new window you should choose
<b>[install]</b>.  The component will be placed under [samples]

<p>
After installing the component you will need to tell Delphi where it can
find the files that belong to it. Go to <b>[Tools]</b>, <b>[Environment
Options]</b>, <b>[Library]</b>, <b>[Library Path]</b>. Add the following
paths here:
<ul>
<li>The path where Delphi can find <i>DelphiZlib.dpk</i> ($PATH)</li>
<li>$PATH\Zlib</li>
<li>$PATH\Other</li>
</ul>
If somebody knows how I can set this automatic, please let me know.

<p>
<b>Important if you are upgrading:</b> Please remove the old component
completely before you install the new one. Make sure there are no old
files left. Delphi (at least for me) is not always rebuilding components
in a correct way.

<h2><a NAME="future"></a>And in the future..</h2>
Unfortunately I don't have much time at the moment, so don't expect me
to fully develop this component into a new WinZip. When I'll have more
time I'll start writing a TZip component also based on the Zlib library.
Please let me know if I should add or change something.

<p>
But first I'll finish the TUnTar component. I'll try to make it in such a
way that gzipped tar-files can be extracted more efficient.

<h2>
<a NAME="faq"></a>FAQ:</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>How can I add multiple files to 1 gzip file?</b><br>
    You can't. Gzip only compresses 1 file. If you want to compress more
    files to a single file use e.g. zip.</li>
<li><b>What is the best way to de-install your component?</b><br>
    I don't know if this is the best way, but this is the way I do it:
    Remove the directory where you installed the component, including
    all .dcu and .bpl files. Start Delphi and when Delphi asks if it
    should try to load the component next time you start, answer no.
    This way you're sure there are no old files around when you want to
    upgrade the component. (Don't forget to remove the library paths if
    you want to get rid of this component for ever.)</li>
<li><b>The component does not work, will you implement function x-y-z,
    how can I...?</b><br>
    Please check my web-site if there is not a newer version. Some
    Delphi sites are distributing an old version of my component (Sorry
    for that, but I have no influence on that except changing the license
    which I don't want to do.) If this does not solve your question,
    mail me. Sometimes it will take some time before I react, but I
    definitely will answer you.</li>
